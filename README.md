## How to Play:

+ Starting with Player 1 (yellow), players alternate flipping over the top card from their deck into the center pile

+ SLAP the center deck if a player lays down a Jack or Wild card! Card pairs (two of the same number on top) and sandwiches (ie, a 5 is dealt, then an 8, then another 5) also count. If you are the first one to slap the center pile, you get all the cards in the center stack!

  > + **Player 1** will use the '**Q**' key to flip a card, and the '**F**' key to slap
  > + **Player 2** will use the '**P**' key to flip a card, and the '**J**' key to slap

  

+ If one player runs out of cards, the other player will continue to deal until a Jack is flipped. **Only Jacks are allowed to be slapped if one player is out of cards!** If the player without any cards slaps the Jack, they get the center pile and are back in the game. If the other player slaps first, game over!

+ **Beware!** If a player slaps when there is no Jack, Wild, doubles, or sandwiches on the center pile, they are penalized by giving the top card of their deck to the other player. 

+ Gain all the cards into your deck to win!

## Features

+ Player's stack of cards changes dynamically with how many cards are in it. The color glow around the deck gets larger and the deck gets fuller as it increases in size. 
+ Card counters are displayed under each deck, which grow or shrink when gaining or losing cards respectively.
+ Player win counts are stored locally and displayed above the deck. 
+ Cards played into the center pile will always be placed with a random rotation to simulate flipping a card over. 
+ Center pile has a unique animation that plays whenever a player slaps.
+ When one player is reduced to below 10 cards, their deck border changes to an animated glowing pink color.
+ When one player is out of cards and only Jacks are allowed to be slapped, a 'Jacks ONLY!' message gets displayed and animated above the center pile. 
+ Deck glow colors have been designed to be distinguishable to players with most forms of color blindness.
